## a very simple front-end templating demo using underscore and jQuery

*DESCRIPTION*
- Demo implementation of ui templates using underscore's templating with default format erb style. 
- Template data loaded via jQuery.ajax

*NOTES*
- You may see an error of same origin policy, when you run this demo locally without a webserver. I didn't notice this issue with firefox. If you are using chrome there is pleny of documentation out there on how to disable web security. You may also run it from a local web server without same origin issues.
